**How to use**

1. Paste a *Sentence* and (optionally) a DOI/URL in *Literature Link*.
2. Click **Add triple** to create one or more (source, relation, sink) triples.
3. Use dropdowns for entity types and relation; choose **Other…** if you need a new label.
4. Click **Save** — the sentence is stored once, and all triples link to it.

**Notes**
- One sentence can have multiple triples.
- If your backend has different endpoint paths, edit `API_*` constants at the top of the file.
